## Installation



### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/pacyuzu16/Rocket-game.git
   cd Rocket-game
2. **Verify Java Installation**:

                                 java -version

                                 Ensure JDK 8+ is installed.

### Compile the Code:
use your terminal or cmd and navigate to Rocket-game/dist then use the following coomand:                       
                                 
   
                                java -jar "ROCKET-GAME"
                                Or use an IDE(like Apache NetBeans) to build the project.

***Check Assets***: Confirm game/image/plane.png, game/image/background.png, and sound files exist in the correct directories.

### Controls
A / Left Arrow: Rotate spaceship left.

D / Right Arrow: Rotate spaceship right.

**Space**: Speed up the spaceship.

J: Fire small bullets (unlimited).

K: Fire large bullets (10 max, reloads every 10 seconds).

Enter: Start game or confirm name entry.

Q: Return to home or quit (confirm with Y/N).

## How It Works

**Rocket Game** is a 2D arcade shooter powered by Java Swing and AWT, designed for smooth and engaging gameplay. Key technical aspects include:

- **Game Loop**: Maintains a consistent 60 FPS using a dedicated thread, ensuring fluid rendering and updates.
- **State Machine**: Manages five game states (Startup, Name Entry, Playing, Game Over, Confirm Quit) for a seamless user experience.
- **Collision System**: Leverages AWT’s `Area` class for precise detection of collisions between the player, bullets, and enemy rockets.
- **Multithreading**: Uses separate threads for keyboard input, bullet movement, and rocket spawning to keep gameplay responsive.
- **High Score Persistence**: Saves the top score and player name to `highscore.txt` using Java NIO, updated when a new high score is achieved.
- **Audio-Visual Effects**: Combines particle-based explosion animations with sound effects for shooting, hits, and destruction, enhancing immersion.

## Known Limitations
**Decompiled Code**: The source was decompiled with FernFlower, which may lack original comments or have minor artifacts.

**Asset Dependencies**: Missing image or sound files will cause errors or silent gameplay.

**Performance**: Heavy use of threads may lead to performance issues on low-end systems.
